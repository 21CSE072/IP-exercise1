<h1>Apple fruit</h1>
<p>
Apples are rich in quercetin and pectin,<br>
both of which are credited for supplying apples with their health benefits.<br>
Quercetin is a flavonoid, a type of naturally occurring plant chemical that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.<br>
Pectin is a type of soluble fiber that may help prevent constipation and have a modest effect on lowering LDL, the “bad” cholesterol.<br>
Pectin is also fermented by beneficial bacteria in the colon,<br>
which produces short chain fatty acids that may play a role in the prevention of chronic diseases,<br>
including certain cancers and bowel disorders.<br>
The type of fiber found in apples improves your gut-friendly<br>
which may be why the fruit is thought to help protect against chronic diseases<br>
<p>
Apples are considered nutrient-dense fruits, meaning <br>
they provide a lot of nutrients per serving.<br>
The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend 2 cups of fruit daily for a 2,000-calorie diet,<br> 
emphasizing whole fruits, like apples<br>
